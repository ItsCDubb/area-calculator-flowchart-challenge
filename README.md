# area-calculator-flowchart-challenge
| Shape     | formula             |
| --------- | ------------------- |
| Square    | width^2             |
| Rectangle | width * length      |
| Circle    | pi * radius^2       |
| Triangle  | (base * height) / 2 |

Your algorithm should:

Ask the user which of the above four shapes they would like to calculate the area of,
Based on the chosen shape, your algorithm should ask the end user to enter the required dimensions (e.g. width, or width and length or radius or base and height),
Calculate and display the area of the chosen shape.
